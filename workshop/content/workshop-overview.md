This workshop is meant to introduce you to the tools used to build on k8's.

The first exercise will require some command line knowledge. The rest of them will require familiarity with go or
the ability to translate the examples from go to another programming language. Kubebuilder only creates go code.
If you lack the technical background for these exercises, consider finding a pair or just
skimming through the links in the training material to understand the tools purpose.

Suggested Timebox for workshop: 4 hours
